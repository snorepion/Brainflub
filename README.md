# Brainflub: the language of the future

## What is Brainflub?

You're probably asking yourself this question right now. Brainflub is a programming language written entirely in symbols - so that it can be used universally without language barriers.
It's super easy to use! Just download the compiler, read the documentation, and get coding! 

## Why should I use Brainflub?

First of all, it's easy to learn. There are only 10 commands, yet there are an infinite number of things you can do with them. Each command is only one letter, so you don't have to memorize
anything long and hard to remember like "try" or "for." 

Second of all, it compiles very quickly. You can write a 300-byte long script and it'll compile in milliseconds! 

Third of all, it's configurable. A library is available so that you can quickly integrate the power of Brainflub into your application, and it's released under the MIT license so you can
do basically whatever you want with it!

## What can Brainflub do?

It can do some pretty amazing things despite its short commands. You can even make an ASCII Mona Lisa!

## Wow, I'm liking this idea. How do I learn Brainflub?
